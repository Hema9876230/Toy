Placement Prediction Model ðŸŽ“
This project is a simple Machine Learning pipeline that predicts student placement based on CGPA and IQ using Logistic Regression.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: placement.csv

Features: cgpa, iq

Target: placement (0 = Not Placed, 1 = Placed)

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Mlxtend (for decision boundary)

Pickle (model saving)

ðŸš€ Workflow
Data preprocessing and visualization

Train-test split (90-10)

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Model training using LogisticRegression

Evaluation using accuracy_score

Visualization of decision boundary

Model saved as model.pkl

ðŸ§ª Accuracy
Test Accuracy: 80%

ðŸ“¸ Visualization
Decision boundary plotted using mlxtend.plotting.plot_decision_regions.

ðŸ“¦ Model Export
Model saved using pickle as model.pkl for later use.
